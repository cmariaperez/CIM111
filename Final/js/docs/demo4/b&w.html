      <h2>THE PSYCHOLOGY OF BLACK AND WHITE</h2>
      <h3>Busines 101, May 2018, 2017</h4>


      <p>We’ve shared earlier a basic understanding of how critical color decisions can be in business. Understanding color and its impact isn’t just visual, but can increase brand recognition and loyalty. Making these decisions is difficult because every individual filters color with their own conscious and subconscious associations. Understanding these associations within the audience for whom your work, service, or product is intended is essential to making smart color decisions, bridging the gap between what you are trying to communicate and what is actually perceived. We explored this reality with the color blue, the color red, the color green and the color yellow. Let’s now address two colors that go hand-in-hand: black and white.

Before exploring how black and white speak, let’s first deal with the “elephant in the room.” Some of you may have seen the title of this post and said, “But wait, [black or white] isn’t a color, it’s the absence of all colors!” If that’s you, we suggest that you keep reading.

<h4>A BRIEF LESSON IN COLOR THEORY</h4>
In terms of light frequencies (additive color theory), white is the presence of all colors and is therefore a color. Black is not; without light everything is black. However, when thinking about color in terms of physical pigments (subtractive color theory), like paint, the tables turn; white is not considered a color while black is the presence of all colors. You can learn more about this on the Color Matters website.

With color theory and your opinion of what is and isn’t a color aside, we would all agree and accept that black and white are indeed colors. After all, we describe them as such. And let’s face it; if anyone tries to tell you that black and white are not colors, what would they say if you ask them what colors a zebra is.

<h4>HOW BLACK SPEAKS</h4>
Black is visually heavy. Its message is therefore very strong. Black’s most common association is power, authority and strength. It is for this reason that too much black can become overwhelming. In stories of good versus evil black and darkness is always symbolic of the villain (Darth Vader being a prime example). Other associations of black include intelligence (black horn-rimmed glasses), professionalism (suit and briefcase), mourning and mystery. As a deep and serious color, black can direct communication in a powerful way.

<br>
<h4>HOW WHITE SPEAKS</h4>
White is considered safe and open. While black is symbolic of evil, white is directly linked to that which is righteous, good and peaceful (sticking with the Star Wars theme, Luke Skywalker is an effective example). Furthermore, white projects clarity, cleanliness (doctors in white coats), purity (wedding dresses) and salvation. White is said to promote creative thought (a blank white board) and is also synonymous with fresh beginnings. As a positive, clear and open color, white can direct communication in a powerful way.</p>
