    <div class="box" id="box2"><h4>1.) Concept</h4></div>
    <div id="box2info"><p>First you must determine a concept for your shoot. Is there a story you want to tell? If this shoot is for yourself, whether for fun or for your portfolio, the sky is the limit here. You can do whatever you want. If you struggle to dream up an interesting concept, try answering the following questions.
          <br>
          <br>
          1.) What are some of your favorite movies, genres, books, etc. Can you style a shoot around that concept?
          <br>
          2.) Is there a location or model that inspires you? What story can you design around those inspirational things?
          <br>
          3.) Is there a story or emotion from your life you want to communicate to the world?
          </p></div>

    <div class="box" id="box3"><h4>2.) Mood Board</h4></div>
    <div id="box3info">  <img src="images/moodboard.jpg" width="400">
      <br>
      <p>A mood board (or inspiration board) is a physical or digital collage of ideas that is commonly used as inspiration. It can include just about anything: photography, designs or illustrations, color palettes, textures, descriptive words.. anything that helps you define the direction of your shoot.


    </p></div>

    <div class="box" id="box4"><h4>3.) Location</h4></div>
    <div id="box4info"><p>You need to be willing to put the time in to explore to find some great locations.

          My three favorite methods are:
          <br>

        1.  Google Maps
          <br>
        2.  Driving and Always Taking the Scenic Route
          <br>
        3.  Asking Other Local Photographers</p></div>
    <div class="box" id="box5"><h4>4.) Casting</h4></div>
    <div id="box5info"><p>1. Instagram: One of the easiest ways to find models is to check out Instagram! Click on profiles or tags to find potential models. If you're interested in collaborating, send them a DM and ask them if they'd like to test with you. Always be polite, share your website address with them so that they can see your work, and explain what kind of imagery you'd like to shoot. They may be interested, or they may not.
      <br>
      <br>
      2. Friends of Friends: One of the best ways to find models can be to simply ask friends if they know of any girls or boys who they think could make good models, or know any who actively like modelling.
      <br>
      <br>
      3. Facebook Groups: I've not had a huge amount of luck with this, but most areas now have Facebook groups dedicated to models of that area. Pretty much anyone can join these, so you probably have to do a lot of digging to find someone who will fit your look. But dont discount these places, I've definitely found a couple of models thanks to Facebook groups of these kinds! Just search for "Models in YOUR AREA" on Facebook, and see what comes up.

    <div class="box" id="box6"><h4>6.) Equipment</h4></div>
    <div id="box6info"><p>A list of items that absolutely must be available while working: <br>
1. Extra memory cards with more capacity.
   <br>
2. Extra batteries for camera and flash. Do not forget to charge them before walking out the door.
<br>
3. Battery charger. Yes you may need to recharge on-site.
<br>
4. Tripod. This should always be with you.
<br>
5. Sensor cleaning kit and lens cleaning cloth. These can be lifesavers when dust shows up.
<br>
6. A laptop if shooting tethered.
<br>
7. Necessary cables for cameras, lights, and computer.
<br>
8. Backup media for ensuring you keep your files intact.
<br>
9. Flash units and/or lighting. Be prepared by bringing a complete set of lights and battery packs.
<br>
10. Extension cords, power strips, and plug adapters. These will be essential!
<br>
11. Light stands, umbrella heads, and ankle weights for anchoring your stands.
<br>
12. Reflectors. These can be key when using ambient light.
<br>
13. Pocket Wizards for remote flash operation.
<br>
14. Gels and filters for lenses and flashes.
</p></div>
    <div class="box" id="box7"><h4>7.) Set It Up</h4></div>
    <div id="box7info"> <p> There are a lot of online tutorials that will help you understand lighting and give you a step by step on how to properly set up all your equipment.

      <p> Its time to shoot! Turn on some music and have fun. To be creative you have to let yourself go a litte bit. The best pictures will be the ones you didnt expect coming at all.
